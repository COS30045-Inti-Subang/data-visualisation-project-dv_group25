Due 15 Nov by 23:59 Points 56 Submitting a file upload Available 29 Sep at 0:00 - 16 Nov at 23:59

Purpose

The purpose of this submission is to demonstrate that you and your team can develop an interactive data visualisation for the Data Visualisation Project.

The submission consists of two parts:

Design Book (evidence of data processing and your design process)

Website containing interactive data visualisation

Your Project must satisfy the brief provided in: Project Topic

This is a team deliverable worth 45% of your final mark.

Teams will be formed by your tutor in Week 8.

Students will be required to work on their own if they:

have NOT made an effort to be placed in a team before Week 9,

have NOT meaningfully communicated with their team before Week 9 Class, or

have NOT contributed to teamwork before Week 10 Stand-up.

Academic Integrity

See: Academic Integrity

IN ADDITION - You must submit work in progress for each Stand-up.

That is, you must:

submit expected milestones for Stand-Ups,

demonstrate understanding of work submitted for Stand-Up

Students who achieve two or more fail marks on the Project Stand-Ups may have their mark reduced relative to the achieved mark.

Lack of continuity between final Project and works submitted for stand-ups may result in an integrity investigation and/or a reduction in your Project mark relative to achieved mark.

Teamwork

Non-contribution to a team assessment is considered a matter of Academic Integrity.

Students who are rated poorly by their team mates, or are otherwise identified as not fully participating in the Project, may have their mark reduced relative to the achieved mark.

2025 S1 Project Topic and Data Set

For this semester's Data Visualisation Project, you will work in a small team to research, design and build an interactive data visualisation for a website. The website is to be hosted on Swinburne’s Mercury server.

Project Brief

The Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE) has been publishing Australian transport statistics since 1970.  Their data collection on road safety enforcement data (e.g., fines for mobile phone use, speeding etc and drug testing) goes back to 2008. However, in 2023 they started collecting more fine grained detail about road safety enforcementLinks to an external site.

 (e.g., location, age group, arrests and charges).

Unfortunately their current Police Enforcement DashboardLinks to an external site.

 does not take into account the new level of detail. For this project you will design and implement (Subang Campus) at least 2 different visualisations/charts and 1 Map related visualisation. All visulaisations must implement filtering, animation, or any types of user interactivity:

allow users to explore selected parts of this data,

tells a story about some aspect of this data.

You will also need to evaluate the usability of your visualisation.

See Assignments for marking rubrics and submission details when available.

Project Resources

Personnel

For this Project you will work in a team of 2-3 students.  It is expected that your team will be quite diverse, with students specialising in software, information systems, networking, data science and cybersecurity participating in this unit. In addition, there a variety of nationalities and educational backgrounds. This diversity reflects the real-world nature of work in a modern world.

Time

Teams will be formed in Week 8 (after the Easter semester break). The team will have 6 weeks in total to complete the project (i.e., 5 weeks of semester plus one week after semester (i.e., a Week 13 submission)).

It is expected that each student will need to put in approximately 6-8 hours of work per week on this project in the second half of semester.

Software

Visual Studio Code (or code editor of your choice)

GitHub

KNIME

Confluence (optional)

Jira (optional)

Web hosting

Swinburne Mercury server

Technical Skills

Most students in this unit should have completed First and Second Year or the equivalent in either:

Bachelor of Information and Communication Technology,

Bachelor of Cybersecurity, or

Bachelor of Computer Science (Data Science major).

Minimum skill:

COS10009 Introduction to Programming is a requisite for this unit.

Other skills:

Unless doing this unit as an elective in degree not listed above, students should also have skills in:

Basic web programming (e.g., COS10005, COS10026)

Teamwork and team management  (e.g. ICT10022, ICT20025, COS10025, COS10026, COS20031).

Other relevant skills your team members may have:

Design thinking and usability testing (e.g., ICT20025)

KNIME (e.g., COS10022)

Database (e.g., COS20026, COS20015)

Students who completed ICT20025 and COS20031 are expected to be familiar with Jira and Confluence.

D3 Skills

The visualisations in your website are to to be built using D3.

The programming exercises in the Laboratory component of the unit will equip you to import simple data sets, construct basic chart types and simple interactive features in D3.

However, for more complicated/custom charts and data sets necessary for high marks in some project assessment criteria your team will need to undertake further independent research.

Generic Skills

To complete this Project you will need to have (or develop) the following generic skills:

good English written and spoken communication

good organisational and time management skills

basic word processing skills, including use document templates (style headings etc)

excel skills

Swinburne holds a number of study, academic and language workshops to help you improve on these basic skills:

Workshops and short courses, English Language Skills

Study Support and Academic Skills

These workshops and skills sessions are free for Swinburne Students.

Skill Level

We understand that there will be students who are stronger in some skills than others. Where possible we will encourage the formation of balanced teams so each team member has a chance to contribute to all aspects of the project.

Data Visualisation Project Reflection (individual)

Due 15 Nov by 23:59 Points 26 Submitting a file upload Available 29 Sep at 0:00 - 16 Nov at 23:59

Purpose

As part of your final submission for the Data Visualisation unit, you are required to write a personal reflection that explores your design process, your technical and conceptual development, and the lessons you’ve taken away from the unit. This reflection is your opportunity to think critically about your own journey through the unit and to discuss how the key learning outcomes have been applied in your project.

Your reflection should be clearly structured with headings, and written in your own voice. You’re encouraged to include visuals (e.g. sketches, screenshots, diagrams) where relevant. Examples of your own work and lived experience are essential for this assessment.

Generic discussions of code, or description of design process which mirror that in Project Design Report, will not be accepted as evidence.

This is an individual submission worth 20% of your final mark.

Suggested Structure

It is suggested that you have at least three major sections (i.e., design, data and programming and team work). For GenAI you can include a fourth stand alone section or incorporate your use of GenAI into relevant sections as required. Each major section may have subsections to help structure your work.

Submission Requirements

File submission

Format: written document (no template for this assessment)

Word Limit: 1,500 (min) to 2,500 (max) words

File type: PDF (ZIP files will not be assessed)

Resubmission: Not permitted

SPECIAL NOTE

The use of GenAI is restricted in this assessment.

It may be used to assist drafting a structure for this report only.

Do NOT use GenAI to write your reflection or peer assessments.

Your reflection MUST be in your OWN voice and only include your personal experiences.  This work will be marked by your tutor and will be assessed against their knowledge of your behaviour and engagement in class, demonstrations and stand-ups. Reference to any events or work clearly not part of this unit will be penalised heavily and may be subject to academic integrity investigation.

True descriptions of less than ideal behaviour will score better than fake descriptions of idealised behaviour.

Be very careful using applications to improve your grammar these can sometimes make your writing appear as if written by GenAI and may be penalised accordingly.
