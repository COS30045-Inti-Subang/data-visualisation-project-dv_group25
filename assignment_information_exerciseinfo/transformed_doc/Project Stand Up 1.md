![This image shows a series of large, light gray cubes arranged diagonally across a gray background. On top of each cube, there are small illustrated people, each engaged in different activities such as sitting, standing, working on laptops, reading, or talking. The cubes and people create a sense of progression or steps. The last cube on the right is highlighted in orange, with a person sitting on it, drawing attention to that position. The overall style is isometric and minimalist.](./Project%20Stand%20Up%201_images/image_001.png)

![This image depicts a conceptual illustration of a blockchain or distributed ledger network. It shows multiple white cubes connected by black lines, representing blocks of data linked together. The cubes are arranged in a grid-like pattern, and the connecting lines indicate relationships or data flow between the blocks, symbolizing how information is securely shared and maintained across a decentralized network. The overall design is minimalistic and uses a monochromatic color scheme.](./Project%20Stand%20Up%201_images/image_002.png)
