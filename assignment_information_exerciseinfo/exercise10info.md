# Exercise 10 Project management

### Aim

Make sure you are working well and are well prepared for project.

Get feedback and work on Project.

### Purpose

Over the course of the semester you should have:

* * * built the skills necessary to do a basic version of the project
    * an understanding of time required to do the different tasks.

You will need both these to successfully complete the Project. In addition, consider how much time you will have as assessments pile up towards the end of semester and how much time team members will be able to devote to the project.

### Project Management

Thinks to think about:

* * * Mission statement for project
      * what are you trying to achieve as a team?
    * Teamwork
      * what skills and resourced does each team member have?
      * how much time do team members have to devote to project?
      * how well is the team working together?
      * do you need a team agreement?
    * Schedule
      * how will you know if you are ahead or behind?
      * what milestones are you aiming for and when, to make sure you meet team goals?
      * what will you do if you get behind schedule?
    * Risk management
* * * * what things might prevent the team from achieving their goal?
      * what can the team do to minimise risks?

When considering risk in this Project it might be useful to consider:

* * things you have learned in other units about managing a project
  * what you are getting 'paid' for each section of the Project (i.e., marks for certain deliverables)
  * fall back position if you are attempting something very ambitious (i.e., what is you minimum viable product)!

*To achieve great things, two things are needed; a plan, and not quite enough time.*
