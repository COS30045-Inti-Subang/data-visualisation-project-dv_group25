# Data Visualisation Project Reflection (individual)

* **Due** **15 Nov** **by** **23:59**
* **Points** **26**
* **Submitting** **a file upload**
* **Available** **29 Sep at 0:00 - 16 Nov at 23:59**

### Purpose

As part of your final submission for the Data Visualisation unit, you are required to write a personal reflection that explores your design process, your technical and conceptual development, and the lessons you’ve taken away from the unit. This reflection is your opportunity to think critically about your own journey through the unit and to discuss how the key learning outcomes have been applied in your project.

Your reflection should be clearly structured with headings, and written in your own voice. You’re encouraged to include visuals (e.g. sketches, screenshots, diagrams) where relevant. Examples of your own work and lived experience are essential for this assessment.

Generic discussions of code, or description of design process which mirror that in Project Design Report, will not be accepted as evidence.

This is an **individual** submission worth **20%** of your final mark.

### Suggested Structure

It is suggested that you have at least three major sections (i.e., design, data and programming and team work). For GenAI you can include a fourth stand alone section or incorporate your use of GenAI into relevant sections as required. Each major section may have subsections to help structure your work.

### Submission Requirements

#### File submission

*Format: *written document (no template for this assessment)

*Word Limit: *1,500 (min) to 2,500 (max) words

*File type:* PDF (ZIP files will not be assessed)

 *Resubmission* : Not permitted

#### Peer Assessment

Completed Peer Assessment

### Academic Integrity

See [Academic Integrity](https://swinburne.instructure.com/courses/70133/pages/academic-integrity "Academic Integrity")

**SPECIAL NOTE**

The use of GenAI is restricted in this assessment.

It may be used to assist drafting a structure for this report only.

Do NOT use GenAI to write your reflection or peer assessments.

Your reflection MUST be in your OWN voice and only include your personal experiences.  This work will be marked by your tutor and will be assessed against their knowledge of your behaviour and engagement in class, demonstrations and stand-ups. Reference to any events or work clearly not part of this unit will be penalised heavily and may be subject to academic integrity investigation.

True descriptions of less than ideal behaviour will score better than fake descriptions of idealised behaviour.

Be very careful using applications to improve your grammar these can sometimes make your writing appear as if written by GenAI and may be penalised accordingly.

### Extensions and Late Penalties

### Academic Integrity

See: [Academic Integrity](https://swinburne.instructure.com/courses/70133/pages/academic-integrity "Academic Integrity")

Stand-Ups must demonstrate progression towards final Project.

Final Project submissions that:

* * * deviate significantly from work presented in stand-ups (without prior discussion with teaching staff),
    * demonstrate little to no progress on Project during semester,

may be investigated for Academic Integrity.

**Make sure you are fully prepared to discuss any work that you submit!**

**IMPORTANT: Excessive commenting of code, or heavy reliance on comments (i.e., reading comments rather than describing personal experience) during a stand-up, will be deemed to be 'use of ****G** **enAI** **'.**

1. Finalize Group Members and the
   leader.
3. The leader needs to create GitHub
   Team and allow other members to join. Check the guide on Canvas module.
4. Review the project specifications
   and conduct meeting on how to progress for the group project.
5. Project requirements: At least 2
   visualization (charts) & 1 visualization using Map. Check the Assignment
   Process Book rubrics
6. Item 4 above must implement
   animations and interactivity for the user such as filtering, zoom, tooltips,
   etc.
7. **Next Week 9 Demo 3** – All sections will demo during the lab session except for Section C2
   & T2 that will demonstrate during class session. Other sections are not
   required to come for the F2F class session unless you have some Q&A or to
   verify something.
8. Conduct Group meeting and **prepare for
   Standup Meeting 1**materials and submission. Prepare 6 minutes video
   (2 minutes each member). How to prepare for the video, view the guide below.
9. **Submission of Standup
   Meeting 1 materials by end of week 9.**
10. All groups that are individual also
    need to do standup meeting 1, materials need to adjust accordingly.
11. Use Week 8 slides onwards (Chart Accessibility)
    to guide your website and visualization design in project.

**Requirements
& guides for the 6 minutes video for standup meeting 1.**

1. All members must present, refer to
   the Standup Meeting 1 page for items to cover.
2. Each person must mention his/her
   name and section.
3. Each member must select which item
   to cover, for example:

a.      Draft of process book – introduction
section etc. (open and explain nor more than 30 seconds)

b.      Datasets that your group have
collected, how you have analyze them, clean them, prepare for visualisation
etc. Use KINME to do this.

c.      One or more members need to explain
how your group processes the data (join them, columns selection, identify
missing data etc.). Use KINME to do this.

4. Team leader must show in the video
   that the GitHub team already created with team members already joined. (5 sec
   duration – no explanation required)
5. Each member can have separated 2
   minutes video, then can combined into 1 complete video.
6. The video must show your face and also
   display the materials that you want to show during the presentation; such as
   the Australian website  and where you get
   the dataset, process of preparing your dataset with KNIME, PowerPoint slides
   summarizing your progress etc.
7. The slide can be presented by one
   member and covers updates of progress, issue the team faced and what your team
   are going to do next. 1 or 2 slides enough.
8. Show how your group use KNIME
   workflow to view the dataset that you have downloaded, conduct data cleaning
   and preparations such as removing missing value row, filter columns of your
   interest for the visualization, remove rows of old records (maybe all before
   2020 records are removed), combine or split table(s), etc. Expected - 1 minute
   explanation. This KNIME data preparation workflow need to be submitted and can
   be use again later for other data processing at later phase.

# 2025 S1 Project Topic and Data Set

For this semester's Data Visualisation Project, you will work in a small team to research, design and build an interactive data visualisation for a website. The website is to be hosted on Swinburne’s Mercury server.

### Project Brief

The Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE) has been publishing Australian transport statistics since 1970.  Their data collection on road safety enforcement data (e.g., fines for mobile phone use, speeding etc and drug testing) goes back to 2008. However, in 2023 they started collecting more fine grained detail about [road safety enforcement**Links to an external site.**](https://www.bitre.gov.au/publications/2024/road-safety-enforcement-data) (e.g., location, age group, arrests and charges).

Unfortunately their current [Police Enforcement Dashboard**Links to an external site.**](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTAxY2EyOTAtYTdhMS00NTRiLWI0NDktM2U1ZDI0NzY0ZTU5IiwidCI6ImFhMjFiNjQwLWJhYzItNDU2ZC04NTA1LWYyY2MwN2Y1MTc4NCJ9 "Link") does not take into account the new level of detail. For this project you will design and implement (Subang Campus) at least 2 different visualisations/charts and 1 Map related visualisation. All visulaisations must implement filtering, animation, or any types of user interactivity:

* * * allow users to explore selected parts of this data,
    * tells a story about some aspect of this data.

You will also need to evaluate the usability of your visualisation.

See [Assignments](https://swinburne.instructure.com/courses/70133/assignments "Assignments") for marking rubrics and submission details when available.

## Project Resources

### Personnel

For this Project you will work in a team of 2-3 students.  It is expected that your team will be quite diverse, with students specialising in software, information systems, networking, data science and cybersecurity participating in this unit. In addition, there a variety of nationalities and educational backgrounds. This diversity reflects the real-world nature of work in a modern world.

### Time

Teams will be formed in Week 8 (after the Easter semester break). The team will have 6 weeks in total to complete the project (i.e., 5 weeks of semester plus one week after semester (i.e., a Week 13 submission)).

It is expected that each student will need to put in approximately 6-8 hours of work per week on this project in the second half of semester.

### Software

* * Visual Studio Code (or code editor of your choice)
  * GitHub
  * KNIME
  * Confluence (optional)
  * Jira (optional)

### Web hosting

Swinburne Mercury server

### Technical Skills

Most students in this unit should have completed First and Second Year or the equivalent in either:

* * * Bachelor of Information and Communication Technology,
    * Bachelor of Cybersecurity, or
    * Bachelor of Computer Science (Data Science major).

#### Minimum skill:

COS10009 Introduction to Programming is a requisite for this unit.

#### Other skills:

Unless doing this unit as an elective in degree not listed above, students should also have skills in:

* * * Basic web programming (e.g., COS10005, COS10026)
    * Teamwork and team management  (e.g. ICT10022, ICT20025, COS10025, COS10026, COS20031).

Other relevant skills your team members may have:

* * * Design thinking and usability testing (e.g., ICT20025)
    * KNIME (e.g., COS10022)
    * Database (e.g., COS20026, COS20015)

Students who completed ICT20025 and COS20031 are expected to be familiar with Jira and Confluence.

#### D3 Skills

The visualisations in your website are to to be built using D3.

The programming exercises in the Laboratory component of the unit will equip you to import simple data sets, construct basic chart types and simple interactive features in D3.

However, for more complicated/custom charts and data sets necessary for high marks in some project assessment criteria your team will need to undertake further independent research.

### Generic Skills

To complete this Project you will need to have (or develop) the following generic skills:

* * good English written and spoken communication
  * good organisational and time management skills
  * [basic word processing skills,](https://swinburne.instructure.com/courses/56074/pages/up-grade-your-word-processing-skills-ms-word "Up-grade your word processing skills (MS Word)") including use document templates (style headings etc)
  * [excel skills](https://swinburne.instructure.com/courses/70133/pages/up-grade-your-spreadsheet-skills-ms-excel "Up-grade your spreadsheet skills (MS Excel)")
